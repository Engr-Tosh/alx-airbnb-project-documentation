# Airbnb Clone - User Stories

This file (`user-stories.md`) outlines key user stories derived from the use case diagram of the Airbnb Clone backend system. It captures the main interactions for each user type—Guest, Host, Admin—and includes system-level requirements.

These stories serve as a foundation for understanding the functional requirements and guiding the implementation of core features like registration, listing management, booking, payments, and dispute resolution.

## File Structure

- `user-stories.md`: Contains 13 well-defined user stories grouped by user roles.

## Purpose

To provide a clear, user-centered perspective for planning, development, and testing of the Airbnb Clone platform.
